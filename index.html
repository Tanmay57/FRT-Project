        <h1>COVID-19 Awareness</h1>
        <p>Unlike other infections, the importance of awareness and preventive measures is very important in containing the spread of COVID-19, as there is a high risk of contamination from a single person which can easily lead to the infections across the community or region if proper precautionary methods are not implemented</p>

<h1>Precautions to be Taken</h1>

<p>Precautions are more important to taken because it helps us to prevent from viruses.</p>

<div class="row">

    <div class="about-col">
        <h3>USE MASK IN PUBLIC PLACES</h3>
        <p>They protect the person wearing them, as > 95% of particles and droplets are held back when inhaling. FFP2-masks also effectively protect the environment as long as there is no exhaling valve. In contrast, masks with an exhaling valve let exhaled air pass out unfiltered,  with contamination of the immediate environment</p>

    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
        <h3>ALWAYS KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING</h3>
        <p>Remember, distancing ourselves from others protects everybody - particularly the more vulnerable in society. It is important to be clear that it is close and extended personal contact that increases our risk of transmission. Coming into close proximity to someone  incidentally is unlikely to lead to transmission.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="about-col">
        <h3>USE HAND SANITIZER</h3>
        <p>Handwashing is important to prevent any contamination especially as the number of Coronavirus cases increase. Wash your hands after taking care of the patient and after taking off the facemasks. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizers if you don't  have water to wash your hands.</p>
